From lighting to poses, we cover everything you need to know.\",\n//     content: `<p>Your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life, and capturing those precious moments is essential. Here are our top 10 tips to ensure your wedding photos are absolutely stunning.</p>\n\n// <h2>1. Choose the Right Photographer</h2>\n// <p>This is perhaps the most crucial decision you'll make. Look for a photographer who specializes in Pakistani weddings and understands the cultural nuances and traditional ceremonies. Review their portfolio extensively and meet them in person to ensure you connect well.</p>\n\n// <h2>2. Plan Your Timeline</h2>\n// <p>Pakistani weddings are elaborate affairs with multiple events. Work with your photographer to create a detailed timeline that includes enough time for each ceremony, outfit changes, and important family moments. Don't forget to allocate time for couple portraits during golden hour.</p>\n\n// <h2>3. Scout Your Venues</h2>\n// <p>Visit your wedding venues before the big day with your photographer. This helps identify the best spots for photos, understand lighting conditions, and plan backup locations in case of weather changes.</p>\n\n// <h2>4. Consider Your Outfits</h2>\n// <p>Your bridal outfits are works of art. Ensure your photographer captures the intricate details of your gharara, lehnga, or sharara. Discuss how different colors and fabrics photograph, especially under different lighting conditions.</p>\n\n// <h2>5. Embrace Natural Light</h2>\n// <p>Natural light creates the most beautiful, soft images. Try to schedule important ceremonies and portrait sessions during times when natural light is available. Morning mehndi ceremonies often produce stunning, naturally-lit photos.</p>\n\n// <h2>6. Capture the Details</h2>\n// <p>The mehndi designs, jewelry, shoes, and invitation cards all tell your story. Ensure your photographer captures these details that you've spent so much time selecting.</p>\n\n// <h2>7. Don't Forget the Candid Moments</h2>\n// <p>While posed portraits are important, the candid moments often become the most treasured photos. The laughter during the dholki, tears during the rukhsati, and joy during the baraat - these authentic emotions create timeless memories.</p>\n\n// <h2>8. Include Family Portraits</h2>\n// <p>Create a shot list for family portraits. Pakistani weddings bring together extended families, and having organized group shots ensures no one is left out. Designate a family member to help gather people for these shots.</p>\n\n// <h2>9. Consider Drone Coverage</h2>\n// <p>Drone photography adds a spectacular dimension to your wedding album. Aerial shots of the baraat, venue decorations, and outdoor ceremonies create stunning visual variety.</p>\n\n// <h2>10. Trust Your Photographer</h2>\n// <p>Once you've chosen your photographer, trust their expertise. They know the best angles, lighting, and moments to capture. Let them guide you while also communicating your must-have shots.</p>\n\n// <p>Remember, your wedding photos are an investment that will last a lifetime. Taking the time to plan and prepare ensures you'll have beautiful memories to cherish forever.</p>`,\n//     featuredImage: \"/placeholder.svg?key=c2ztf\",\n//     author: \"Fatima Shah\",\n//     authorImage: \"/placeholder.svg?key=gf3n7\",\n//     publishedAt: \"2024-11-15\",\n//     readTime: \"8 min read\",\n//     category: \"Photography Tips\",\n//   },\n//   {\n//     id: \"2\",\n//     slug: \"best-wedding-venues-lahore\",\n//     title: \"Best Wedding Venues in Lahore for Stunning Photography\",\n//     excerpt:\n//       \"Explore the most photogenic wedding venues in Lahore that provide the perfect backdrop for your special day.\",\n//     content: `<p>Lahore, the heart of Pakistan, offers some of the most breathtaking venues for wedding photography.
